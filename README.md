# flutterprjgroup1

## Overview

This project is a Flutter eCommerce Application designed as part of the Project 2 assignment for the course. The application is a mock eCommerce store (for example, a shoe or clothing store) built to demonstrate Flutter's UI capabilities, navigation, and design principles. All product data is hard-coded using Dart collections, without the use of Firebase.

## Features

- **Home Screen:** Displays a logo and an introduction to the store.
- **Product Screen:** Showcases products in a ListView using cards with images, names, and prices.
- **Detail Screen:** Provides detailed information about the selected product, including images, descriptions, and a "Buy Now" button.
- **Checkout Screen:** Contains a form where users can enter their details to complete a purchase.
- **Animations & Transitions:** Smooth animations are included to enhance the user experience.

## Design

- **UI/UX Focused:** Emphasis on a clean, modern design with carefully chosen colours, fonts, and padding.
- **Custom Widgets:** Experimentation with various Flutter widgets to improve aesthetics and functionality.
- **Assets:** Incorporation of images and other assets to enrich the visual appearance.
- **Animations:** Use of animations to provide a dynamic and engaging interface.

## Functionality

- **Navigation:** The application supports seamless transitions between the Home, Product, Detail, and Checkout screens using Flutter's navigation techniques.
- **Data Management:** A collection of product data (e.g., a list of shoes with prices, brands, and descriptions) is maintained in Dart and displayed using a ListView.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is designed to work effectively across different mobile devices.
